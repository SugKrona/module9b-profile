# Module 9B - Custom Profile Component

## Description
This is a React app built with Vite. It contains 3 profile component styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to use JSX
- How to style with inline CSS
- How to create and render functional components

## Challenges
Mostly figuring out how to add and fix the hover interactions. Styling issues and making sure they would fit and adjust to diffrent screen sizes. I tried to do other effects but kept struggling so I just left it at the hover interactions for now.
